It’s safe to say that Singapore’s relationship with the Coronavirus has been nothing short of a roller coaster ride. On the 23rd of January, a date which now feels like a lifetime ago, Singapore reported its first official case of COVID-19, a virus that has since swept almost every corner of the planet. The strongly governed city-state nestled at the heart of South-East Asian global markets acted swiftly and decisively to monitor and restrict spread into this densely populated, island nation. Successfully curtailing transmission to extremely low levels worked efficiently to gain Singapore exemplar management status across the world. Enforced social distancing protocol, robust healthcare-testing capacities and cooperative mobile tracking placed Singapore in a respected, prepared position to face the numerous perils of Covid from the get-go.

Of course, every roller coaster must peak, and come April, so did Singapore’s acclaimed height of Covid management. With an alarming and significant climb in new Covid-19 infections sprouting from overpopulated migrant worker dormitories, the Singaporean government was quick to isolate and gazette two such clusters; _Westlite Toh Guan_ and _S11 Dormitory @ Punggol,_ in which 19,800 workers reside. The sudden rise in cases shines a necessary spotlight on the injustice and mistreatment of migrant workers through fundamentally distraught living conditions, many impossible to live distantly in. By April 20th, Singapore was experiencing the highest number of cases in a single day; 1,426, of which 98% were among migrant workers. From its position as South-East Asia’s covid hero, to the region’s most largely infected population, it became clear that Singapore had left a gaping hole in their previously championed plan for resiliency.

The spike in cases of foreign workers and potency of virus transmission in overcrowded, unhygienic living conditions came as no surprise to many. Non-profit organisations such as Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) have been championing quality living standards and the equitable, just treatment of this community for years. Instantly, the grassroots community stepped up to support foreign workers, raising over $900,000 for basic necessities, meals and programmes targeted at their health and well-being. Today, thousands of workers continue to be confined into rooms of varying sizes in areas that have remained gazetted as “isolation zones”. Daily cases are reported in an eerily separative format: “community cases” which include Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, “imported cases” which refer to individuals returning to Singapore from elsewhere, “work permit holders not residing in dorms” and “dorm residents”. Why have we left migrant workers, upon whose hard labor our city is built, outside of our “community”? **Who** is the “we” that Singapore speaks of when relaying positively framed progress, and **who** has been consciously excluded from such frameworks of celebration?

Looking forward, it’s clear that Singapore will be facing significant and long-lasting changes to societal norms and lifestyles as we knew them pre covid. With enterprises, students and employees transitioning on to primarily virtual platforms, Singapore’s already advanced digitalisation has only been catalysed in the past few months. As with cities and nations across the globe, Singapore too has had to make the rapid shift into virtual operations. Luckily, many of these virtual infrastructures and surveillance norms have predated the pandemic in our city. To start, many retailers have already completely halted cash payments with the transition into a cashless transaction culture advancing at a rapid rate. Additionally, employers of half a million migrant workers have made the conscious shift in setting up accounts to pay salaries virtually, given the isolated conditions of worker dorms. Albeit, perhaps not under the best motivations, such bank accounts have allowed for significant ease in remitting funds to these workers’ home countries. The shift into virtuality has also propelled many old-school hawker stalls (formalised food stalls, usually run by elderly demographics) to transition into online marketing and social media-based promotions. A Facebook group titled ‘Hawkers United’ acts as a platform on which **_hawker_** owners can continue to market their produce, so as to improve sales under the current stay at home orders.

While in many ways, Singapore has taken all the right steps in curtailing the negative impacts of coronavirus on our businesses, education, healthcare and other sectors, we must continue to recognize and reflect on the fallacies of our so-called _resilience_ thus far. While fundraising and efficient government-matching strategies have been employed to support our vulnerable populations, what will be changed so as to proactively protect these groups from being left behind in the future? How will our systems redefine equity and who will be eligible as members of our community? These are the revolutions we hope to see shifting our societal perspectives. Singapore may continue to strive forward and reclaim its position as an advanced, innovative and prepared nation, yet it is vital we never forget the lessons we have learnt about humanity and togetherness for the years to come.
