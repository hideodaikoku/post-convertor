The COVID-19 pandemic has become a catalyst for many significant changes, where behaviour change can occur almost as rapidly as the spread of the virus itself. In London, one of the more noticeable shifts I have observed has been towards London’s demand for active transport. While these changes are important, it is equally critical that we work to establish the infrastructure supporting access to active travel for everyone in the community as we move into life after lockdown.

**Alternatives to Public Transport**

The UK was placed under strict lockdown on 23 March, with government advice focussing on staying home and observing social distancing while making necessary journeys. Under these lockdown restrictions, the public were instructed to work from home and London’s train and bus networks to be avoided in order to reduce the risk of infection. In this time, Transport for London (TfL) recorded that Tube travel has been down by 95% and bus travel down by 85%.

After many years of improving London’s public transport capacity and infrastructure, the government were forced to advise Londoners to avoid public transport. In a city that so heavily relies on its public transport system, with around half of all households not owning a car, Londoners now had to find alternative transportation in order to make their necessary trips.

Under lockdown, cycling and walking around London has surged in popularity as locals follow Government guidelines. Some London bike shops have reported a fivefold surge in online sales since the start of April. I have also observed multiple bike repair shops with queues of customers who are bringing out old bicycles for a service or seeking to buy their first bike. TfL recently stated that cycling trips could increase tenfold, and walking trips to increase by five times the normal amount in post-quarantine London. Now with lockdown restrictions slowly easing, Londoners are being encouraged to continue getting around in this way to ensure infection rates don’t cause a second spike.

**Perceptions of Active Travel**

Active transport is an accessible method of transport within a local area. It achieves social equality in that it is inexpensive and crosses both language and technology barriers. Given the right infrastructure, active transport can be accessed by all, including the young, elderly and disabled, whilst providing obvious health and wellbeing benefits.

Prior to the current COVID-19 pandemic, cycling in London was subjectively been seen as unsafe, due to both lack of appropriate infrastructure and large amounts of traffic congestion. In 2019, the _National Travel Attitudes Study (NTAS)_ showed that 61% of adults in England agreed the main reason for not cycling was that _“it is too dangerous to cycle on roads”_.

In the past few weeks, I have observed Londoners reclaiming local streets, with a new sense of confidence, riding along London’s emptier roads during lockdown. There are significantly less cars around, and roads have become occupied by casual cyclists. This has also encouraged those who may never have considered cycling previously, to now purchase or hire bicycles for both recreation and purposeful commuting around London.

While cycling is a big part of active travel, pedestrian-oriented development is equally as important, particularly when people are living more locally due to travel restrictions. While seemingly the easiest mode of transport, walking is not always everyone’s default preference.

According to TfL, prior to lockdown there were approximately 4.6 million car trips in London on an average day, with 35% of these being trips under 2km. In order for people to choose active travel methods over travelling by car, people require a pleasant, safe and accessible experience, which within London is not always the case.

**Post-Quarantine with new travel behaviours**

In early May, the Department for Transport announced a new £250 million emergency active transport fund, which will both encourage and support the increasing number of people choosing walking and cycling as their preferred mode of transport. In coordination with this, TfL and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, also announced the Streetspace for London programme, a long-term project with the aim of fast-tracking the transformation of London’s road network to enable safe and socially distanced cycling and pedestrian networks, as well as preventing people turning to cars for short journeys as an alternative to public transport.

Many London boroughs have taken action by providing temporary interventions that allow for safer pedestrian and cyclist movements throughout London. Pedestrianised streets and widened pavements allow for all-abilities access while socially distancing. Temporary road closures and separated cycle lanes now support the rise in cycling activity. Although temporary, providing these opportunities to the public is an essential step in creating long-term behaviour change, and ensuring everyone within these communities are able to have access to safe travel without breaking restriction rules or exposing themselves to risk of infection. Not just under the current circumstances, but also well into a post-coronavirus future.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating worldwide, it is also providing a catalyst for change on this scale. With everyone’s daily routines disrupted, this in turn makes people more willing to adopt new habits and change perceptions much quicker in order to form a sense of normality. Now with the provision of accelerated innovation in order to adapt to the currently unpredictable human environment, the support for active transport infrastructure couldn’t come at a better time; on the condition it is provided to all within the community, not just those who are asking for it.

The Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change (Prochaska and DiClemente, 1983) devises a model in which the ‘states of change’ occur. Under normal circumstances, Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation and Action take time and come in slow sociocultural shifts. However, under current circumstances there has been significant uptake of active travel in London within the period of lockdown. Now that these behaviours have been embraced, it is important to maintain them by way of providing supporting infrastructure in order to prevent relapse (the return to reliance on private car travel).

Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change)

According to TfL’s _Travel In London_ report (2019), the most common socio-economic group who cycle regularly “tend to be mostly male, white, in employment, and with relatively higher household incomes”. In order to encourage changes in perception of active travel, particularly cycling, it needs to be safe and accessible for all genders, ethnicities and incomes in order to make it truly successful.

Behaviour change is rarely a quick process, however when communities are put under extreme pressure and are required to adapt quickly, it is interesting to see the resilience of communities and how quickly a “new normal” can be implemented. Active travel is just one example of how coronavirus, like other major global events before it, can spur rapid urban change, allowing us time to reflect on how things were, and how we can continue to adapt going forward.
