I wake, eat and fall asleep, all in the same place. I expect exhaustion after spending so long indoors, but a local takeout meal restores my energy. I am repeating these days.

Freelance friends are considering life in rural areas when the functioning world returns. Maybe being situated in Tokyo is not essential to my life afterall. The increase in telework will surely accelerate, as the daily barrage of social media commentary so kindly reminds us.

Does creating a work from ‘anywhere’ culture automatically lead to a geographical dispersion of populations? Can human decisions be so easily parameterised, as in a simulation game?

「Density」
=========

In day-to-day life, “future prediction” that is easy to catch up with is demanded, but even among representative researchers, discussions have not been organized.

Among them, the ones that show a particularly contrasting story will be presented by Joel Kotkin, author of “World History Seen from the City,” and Richard Florida, who advocates “Creative Class.” (Though their debate is not new …)

In these unprecedented times, precocious visions of the future are more sought after than ever, while thought leaders strive to collate their ideas coherently. Perhaps, the most contrasting among them is the ongoing debate in perspective [between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHRMCEkocXc&t=) Joel Kotkin, author of “The City: A Global History” and Richard Florida, who advocates for the notion of a “Creative Class.”

Richard Florida, the representative of Pro-Density Urbanist, advocates the importance of “density” and thinks that “mixing” of creative talent has pushed the industry forward.

He also pointed out that in the short term during the terrorist attacks and the plagues of the last century, people moved to the suburbs, but when the situation ended, they returned to the city center, arguing that it is extremely unlikely that the city will become hollow.

Richard Florida, a proponent of Pro-Density Urbanism, advocates for the importance of ‘density’ and suggests that the ‘blending’ of creative talent has propelled the economy forward. He emphasises that in the face of terrorism and pandemics, the past century’s short term retreats from city centres have eventually reversed; arguing against the likelihood of cities becoming hollow.

In contrast, skeptic of urban density Joel Kotkin highlights the possibility that once dispersed, populations may not return to city centres as they have previously; as modern communication technologies will enable a trend toward a [Los Angeles](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-04-26/coronavirus-cities-density-los-angeles-transit) style low density city model.

This simple contrast does not account for more complex scenarios such as city/suburban hybrid living. This scenario, increasingly popular in Japan, offers not a choice of ‘either-or,’ but in the proportion of time spent in each domain.

Tokyo and suburbs-Through comparison with foreign countries
===========================================================

A commonly expressed sentiment in recent times, is the widespread tendency for cities’ populations to disperse temporarily, before returning to higher density. As in the case of Pro-Density Urbanism introduced earlier, population density fluctuates based on the context of current events; and people return to the city centre once the situation settles.

I vaguely agree with this idea, but am curious about the catalyst for these fluctuations between urban and suburban areas. In considering whether these factors differ between countries, I will compare Tokyo’s urban transition with that of London.

To begin, I would like to understand the inception of each city’s increase in urban population. London’s Industrial revolution saw many farmers move to the city; inspiring a similar trend within Japan, enabled by new rail connections and triggering the move of its distant population to Tokyo. The people of North-East Japan, separated from Tokyo by mountains, had previously looked to the Kansai region, but flowed to Tokyo upon the introduction of modern railways.

As a result, in London, where environmental degradation had progressed due to rapid industrialisation, Cholera spread, leading to advocacy for Howard’s concept of the garden city; and more attention was placed on suburbs. Additionally, the post World War II demolition of slums caused a sharp decline in the population of central London up to 1980.

Tokyo on the other hand, saw a shift toward suburbs for another reason. The city’s rapid development and centralisation of economic activity post WWII forced the growth of suburbs in order to keep pace with population growth, while the Kanto plain’s largely flat developable area offered a major advantage over the mountainous surrounds of the Kansai area.

Despite a rapid decline in population, London’s city centre saw a successful cultural revitalisation during the 1990s, attracting creative talent from across the world. Meanwhile in Japan, land prices plummeted as the post war economic bubble collapsed. The city centre was flooded with low cost housing, triggering a resurgence in the urban population.

It is clear from these examples that a diverse range of triggers cause fluctuations in urban populations. If Covid19 triggers an exodus to the suburbs, which cities will be most affected; and will the benefits of density be compelling enough to attract people back to city centres?

**Sense of Place**
==================

The ‘ability’ to live anywhere does not equate to the ‘compulsion’ to do so; and this is an important distinction. Facilitating a culture of remote work does not necessarily entail a scattering of populations, but one certainty is that going forward, we will have more ‘options’ in where we live.

It is important to note that as the range of possibilities in where to live increases, the differentiating ‘characteristics of places’ becomes increasingly important, as location declines in significance. Therefore, those places which were previously compelling due to distance may become overlooked, based on their lack of unique identities. While the current discussion of this pandemic’s long term effect focuses heavily on our liberation from predetermined space, what matters most is ‘why and where’ we choose to live at a given moment.
