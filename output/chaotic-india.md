Being a country with a population of 1.3 billion, the second largest in the world, India faced a hurdle like no other country when the COVID-19 pandemic touched upon it. The first cases of coronavirus in India were reportedly detected in people with a history of international travel and protective measures began as early as January at major international airports with the screening of incoming passengers but it was later deemed to be ineffective for the asymptomatic carriers. For a country of such enormous size and a large segment below poverty line, it wasn’t easy to control the situation. The medical infrastructure for testing and treatment was limited and awareness minimum. By mid-March when the numbers had already crossed over 100, concerns began to arise leading to a chaotic fear within the citizens. Around the same time WHO had declared it to be a worldwide pandemic resulting in some unprecedented actions taken by the Indian government.

While countries like China, Italy, Spain and UK had already started implementing restrictions and partial lockdown in certain cities, India took a leap and a much-appreciated action by imposing a nationwide lockdown, one of the first globally, on 24th March 2020 followed after a voluntary curfew for 24 hours on 22nd March.

> “Dr. Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India, praised the country’s response to the pandemic, describing it as timely, comprehensive and robust” (UN News, 2020). India’s action has been claimed to be far-sighted with the government taking a timely action while the reported cases were still very low.

While the fourth phase of India’s massive lockdown is still in continuation, it certainly puts certain aspects of the country’s sustenance at stake including economic damage and survival of a major part of its population, the ones dependent on daily wage. India is one of the very few countries with an unquantifiable number of daily wage earners and interstate migrant workers. With the halt of all sorts of government, private and labour related employment, the lives of people came crashing down.

> According to reports, “Unemployment hit 23.5% in April, a sharp spike from 8.7% in March. This is attributed to the lockdown, which brought most economic activity — except essential services such as hospitals, pharmacies and food supplies — to a standstill” (Inamdar; BBC News, 2020).

While the main concern of the mass became survival from the pandemic, millions of migrant workers were desperate to get back home after all modes of public transportation were suspended. The lockdown which was supposed to avoid social gatherings as a means to flatten the Covid-19 curve created an opposite implication. Huge numbers of migrant workers gathered at bus stops and railways stations in major metro cities to return home defeating the whole purpose of the lockdown. The major point raised as a result of such confusion and chaos was that even if the pandemic did not kill the huge segment of unemployed and underprivileged economic minority citizens, hunger and starvation surely would. This called for a huge criticism of the move made by the government.

Although government-initiated projects like PM CARES invited donations to provide relief from the situation created, it was heavily criticised and questioned by opposition parties and many citizens for its authenticity when the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) already existed. The funds contributed were claimed to be unused and the action was unappreciated due to lack of transparency. Even when relief was provided, it was limited and not creating significant improvements to the social situation. While at present many relaxations have been made and private businesses have been allowed to reopen with limited employees, the uncertainty of when the lockdown will end poses a question of survival for the nation.

The world’s largest democracy is certainly dependent on its people. When the major asset of the country, its people, are under the risk of survival, the country’s future seems debatable. Recovering the lost economy would take a while but would resuming the country so soon to its previous functional state be justified? Presently, India’s cumulative growth in the number of active Covid-19 cases is much higher than its Asian neighbours. On one hand, reopening the country could not only lead to a rapid increase in coronavirus cases but also much more death rates resulting from poor and improper hygiene of a significant number of its population living in closed knit communities including slums. On the other hand, further imposition of the lockdown would lead to a collapse of the country’s economy and mass death due to unemployment and starvation. The sad part is that whatever decision the government decides to take the collateral damage to be borne by the country cannot be denied.

Coming to the urban structure and function, things might appear to be the same when looked from the overall point of view but small nuances will create a major lifestyle change. While London might be enjoying its park days and a daily form of outdoor exercise even during the lockdown, India’s post-COVID situation won’t be anywhere near as comfortable. A country with limitation of open public gathering spaces and daily commuters in cities like Mumbai being much more than even the biggest carnival of UK, it is going to take a lot more than merely planning post-quarantine urbanism.

Migration to urban settlements would be monitored and restricted to avoid the collapse of urban infrastructure and system. The number of private vehicles will possibly increase on the roads leading to increased traffic and congestion. That would, however, not mean that public transport would receive a relaxation in footfall, thanks to the population of the country and the speculated increase in it due to the present lockdown. Sanitation and hygiene measures for safety would become the new normal leading to water shortage in urban areas. Tourism shall be affected indefinitely leading to fall of economy in many Indian states like Goa and Rajasthan which are majorly dependent on tourism. While people would gradually go back to how things were before the Covid-19 outbreak and return to the regular lifestyle, an increase in precautions would call for change in urban infrastructure to suit contactless sustenance as much as possible. Design layouts of public and commercial spaces could see a new approach, digital education and working could become more common with many universities already opting for online semesters in the latter half of 2020 and most importantly the psychological well being of people is surely going to remain affected for a long time. The impact of this tremendously long lockdown and living with the constant fear of being infected in the post COVID world might see a rise in mental illnesses amongst many.

The worst part is that the implications won’t be the same for everyone. The social structure will crumble leaving the elite standing alone while the poor will be relinquished. As good as it might sound on paper, the new changes would certainly be more effective in the European countries with a controllable population. For a nation like India where its boon, as well as bane, lies in its population, the country would try every possible way to go back to its normal but the size of the nation, the crammed and overcrowded urban areas wouldn’t allow the same.
