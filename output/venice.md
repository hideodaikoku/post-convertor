**The pandemic in Italy**

As the first European country severely hit by the pandemic, with the first two cases being confirmed on the 30th of January, Italy also was the first to declare the state of emergency and to raise restriction measures in the attempt to face the sanitary crisis. On the 23rd of February, the government put into quarantine the main sites where the virus was initially spreading from and suspended manifestations and public events. However, as more cases were being registered throughout the country, the situation rapidly worsened due to both the high population density of the peninsula and to the highest percentage of the elderly population in Europe (22.8% in 2020.

Consequently, on the 9th of March, the list of restrictions also increased and applied to the whole national territory. During the peak, the main measures opted by the specifically created Extraordinary Commissioner for the Emergency included:

• The lockdown of all commercial activities except those of primary importance (pharmacies, the essential services and shops for food or basic necessities) and the promotion of forms of smart-work.  
• A self-isolation imposed by the prohibition for the population to circulate but for demonstrated working or urgency needs and the reduction of transports mobility schedules.  
• The halt of educational activities of all kinds, substituted by distance-learning platforms.

To verify the respect of the rules, police and military forces were in charge of patrolling streets and public space. The unconformity with the restrictions, as exposed in the self-certificate that citizens were asked to carry with them, was thus punishable with fines from 400 to 3.000€ and the imprisonment up to 5 years (this last unlikely to happen given the overcrowding conditions of the prisons).

Another major novelty within the European Union history has been that many of the members suspended the free mobility guaranteed by the Schengen Agreement, a measure that Italy also embraced on the 26th of March, enforcing ‘limitations or prohibition of departure and access into municipal, provincial or regional territories, as well as with respect to the national territory’ (D.L. 25 March 2020, n.19). A state of national isolation thereby followed.

**Venice faces Covid-19**

Together with the whole territory of Lombardy region, Venice, two more Veneto provinces and 11 more outside the region, were among the first parts of the Italian territory to be put into quarantine state and as such, they suffered more than others the consequences of the confinement. Given the extent to which Venetian and more broadly regional economy depend on income related to the tourism industry (with Veneto ranking first on the list quantifying the number of foreign presences — 16,1% in 2019. ISTAT), heavy economic consequences related to the closing of the borders came along with the loss of human life in further exacerbating the crisis.

Once the island was isolated, besides witnessing the reappearance of the lagoon fauna as a result of the reduction of motorised traffic in the canals, the very peculiar fact has been the manifestation of another kind of inhabitants, usually confused among the crowds of foreigners: namely the local residents. Emptied by tourism, in fact, only a limited number of students who could not or would not leave the island and the Venetian citizens remain.

**Management of the situation and consequences in the urban domain**

A long-standing issue Venice historical centre has been facing is a radical depopulation trend that soared in parallel to the development of tourism infrastructure and services. The resident’s records from the late XX century give a sense of the situation:

*   1951: 174.808
*   1961: 137.150
*   1971: 108.426
*   1981: 93.598
*   1991: 76.644
*   2001: 65.695
*   2011: 58.991
*   2019: 52.143

During the shutdown period, some proposals have been advanced concerning the dwellings once employed at full capacity in the tourism sector and now remained empty. In particular, the one here discussed was put forward by the university institutes and it involves both the municipality and a network of property owners. According to the scheme, the moment is seen as an opportunity to face the housing crisis involving the Venetian students, (30.000 in total, with 2.000 of them accommodated in the university residences and 9.000 looking for an external renting solution) by allocating to these the properties provisionally unoccupied.

In this view, the responsibility to cover the potential gap of incomes, much higher in their usual domain of allotment than in the availability of the new tenants, is handed over to the very educational bodies that are entrusted with the identification of forms of subsistence through further agreements with public or private institutions, namely banks or insurance companies.

The proposal offers some positive insights regarding the possibility of implementing alternative housing schemes that in the future may mitigate the loss of Venetian residents by enhancing the presence and permanence of the graduates and resulting in an overall socio-economical improvement of the local sphere. Nonetheless, of course, the problem will surface again once that the foreign presences will take their place back and with this regard, the official registry specifies that the leasing contracts are in fact of ‘temporary nature’ ([Venice Municipality Official Protocol](https://live.comune.venezia.it/node/35920))

Besides considering the current low presence of students in town due to the restriction measures on national mobility, some further scepticism emerges in so far as the proposal implies works of refurbishment for the dwellings (financed by the municipality) as to raise their standards to liveability conformity. In this vision, the operation rather seems to steer the efforts of the educational and public institutions, all the more critically engaged in such moment, towards the improvement of local properties that with the end of the pandemic will return to their normal renting condition, yet renovated with public resources or opening up compromising agreements with a private sector now also undermined by an unprecedented crisis.

Recently (4th of May), the lockdown measures have recently been loosened, reintroducing the permission for more working activities to be carried out in presence as well as lifting home self-isolation imposition. However, with the hospitality sector standstill being further continued, the Venetian economy is still to feel the impact of the crisis for several months ahead.

More than other emergencies, Covid-19 vividly exposed how the critical emptiness of the residential housing conditions is coupled with the dependence from the monoculture of the mass tourism economy. Besides, not only the moment can stimulate the questioning of our cities resilience with regard to the capacity of facing up to a similar crisis in the future, but also if our responses are appropriate to a sustainable development prioritising the prosperity of local communities. The question, in fact, arises whether short-term housing schemes may by themselves be able to invert the depopulation trend that Venice is inexorably facing as from decades and more broadly if they can be thought without concern for the productive cycles that affect the urban living organism attractiveness for the prospective local long-term residents. Overall, one may wonder about the extent to which our responsiveness is ready to take this as an opportunity of change or it has long time ago embraced the concern to safeguard the status-quo as a priority.

This is meant to be a brief recap of the situation as developed in Italy and particularly in the Veneto region targeting the introduction of some dynamics originated in the Venetian urban domain. The article is dated the 7th of May and it has been written in the three preceding days from my self-arranged workspace in an empty room of a university residence in the Castello district, Venice.
