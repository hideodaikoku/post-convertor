During the last few months, the Spanish capital city has been one of the main red spots in the world map along with Wuhan, Milan and New York, where Covid-19 was spreading.

The reasons why Madrid suffered such a hard knock were several: firstly, a large amount of international flights combined with tourists transiting the streets daily and the Spanish population’s advanced age, resulting in a high rate of fatalities. On the other hand, massive events like [women’s day](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-womens-day-spain/thousands-march-in-spain-on-womens-day-despite-coronavirus-fears-idUSKBN20V0ZJ) were not promptly cancelled, given the relatively late spreading of the virus in Spain if compared to other neighbouring European countries that could serve as a reference. It is thus the lack of foresight, immediate action and general mismanagement from both local and governmental authorities that attributes them a consistent part of responsibility for this situation.

On March 14th, the State of Alarm was eventually decreed throughout the national territory. A late measure that, among other things, involved restrictions on mobility, only allowing the carrying out of essential activities such as the access to workplaces, when working from home was not possible. Class attendance at all educational levels was suspended and only some basic shops such as pharmacies, supermarkets and [tobacco stores](https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/04/05/smoking-and-coronavirus-tobacco-sales-soar-worldwide-as-experts-urge-now-is-the-moment-to-stop/) could stay open. Transport, both public and private, was therefore reduced and limited according to the above conditions.

The whole converted into one of the roughest quarantine measures of all Europe, in which children could not leave their homes and adults were not allowed to go for a walk or practice sports. This, however, did not prevent the collapse of the [sanitary system](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-03-19/spain-enlists-medical-students-to-shore-up-overburdened-healthcare-system.html) or the overcrowding of the city subway in rush hours.

In fact, Spain has reached the not honourable second [position](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20200429/paises-muertos-coronavirus-poblacion/2012350.shtml) in deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, only behind Belgium. Furthermore, external views as the Hong Kong consulting firm Deep Knowledge Group ranked the country as the least safe country in the Eurozone in a [classification](https://www.dkv.global/eurozone-ranking) that measures the effectiveness of quarantine restrictions, government management, health effectiveness, and the social and economic support provided to the citizens during the crisis.

Days go by, spring comes and for a population used to an intense outdoor social life, the hours of confinement can become long, affect moods and generate sleep disorders. In this view, the house and the balcony have taken on a new meaning, being reconstructed not only as a space for seclusion, but also redefining the limits between public and private space. In fact, it is common to look out the window these days and observe neighbours talking from different buildings. However, in the globalized world we live in, with the pandemic being a vivid example of this, now more than ever the medium through which relationships are nurtured is entrusted to telematics means.

The reflection of this through the social networks response consisted of a call to citizen responsibility, as manifested in the now popular hashtag #stayathome. However, self-management and self-censorship are false illusions. In Madrid, respecting the measures is primarily ensured by strict police control and sanctions that, depending on the severity of the infringement, would range between 100 to 30,000€ and with jail sentences from three to eighteen months. Also, confined citizenship -I would not know if aware or bored- control of the behaviour of those passerby gives a good examples of Foucault’s Panopticon theory possible ramifications, namely an oddly popular “window surveillance”. Perhaps the attitude of these new _voyeurs_ may be due to the fact that the decontaminated city, now free from traffic pollution, is becoming more beautiful and sunny every day and confined citizens could not fully enjoy it so far.

**Return to the “new normality”: Rethink the new city.**

By Monday May 4th, Spain had already overcome the peak of the epidemiological curve and the [program](https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020/04/28/actualidad/1588099170_587777.html) to end national confinement began. The overall plan consists of the following stages, reintroducing ‘normality’ with a schedule depending on the severity of each region and, in the best case scenario, it is expected to end in June.

> \- Phase 0. Accompanied walks respecting the interpersonal distance (2m), individual sport activity and opening of small shops by appointment
> 
> \- Phase 1. Meetings of up to 10 people, opening of small shops, cafe terraces, hotels and tourist accommodation up to 50% of the capacity and places of worship (30%). Group sport activities that do not involve physical contact or the need of changing rooms. Rehabilitation of working hours in the food industry sector.
> 
> \- Phase 2. Travel to second residences depending on proximity, opening of shopping malls, restaurants and cultural venues (cinemas, theatres, museums…) with a third of their capacity. Wedding celebration for a limited number of attendees and permission to carry out hunting and fishing activities.
> 
> \- Phase 3. Flexibility towards general mobility. Capacity will be increased in shops and night venues will be opened with safety conditions. Also beaches and national ‘priorities’ such as bullrings will be opened with personal distance limitation.

It is expected that [The Community of Madrid](https://comunidadmadrid.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicInformation/index.html?appid=cdfb61b3eb3a49c2b990b4fdb41dfcfe), being the most affected city, will take time to reach the last stages. Furthermore, the internal configuration and urban structure, highly dependent on public transport, impose serious difficulties (most of the city’s factories and businesses are in the north, but a substantial part of the workforce lives in the south). In times of change like this, we see more clearly the systems in which we are immersed (political, ecological, economic, social, urban), what matters and what does not. Despite everything, in the last 53 days, Madrid has become a healthier, cleaner and less noisy city. The [air quality](http://www.mambiente.madrid.es/sica/scripts/index.php) has improved significantly and the prominence of cars in public space has been partly regained by the few pedestrians allowed to circulate. Would it be possible for this exceptional situation to become permanent?

**A sustainable mobility alternative is possible.**

In recent years, bicycle riding has been shyly settling in Madrid. An unfriendly city for riders who coexist with very aggressive traffic and poor quality of dedicated infrastructure. Despite the fact that the State of Alarm contemplates the use of bicycles, and contrary to what happens in the United Kingdom, China or [Germany](https://medium.com/post-quarantine-urbanism/berlin-where-the-streets-belong-to-children-and-bikes-c2fc98c00523), where riding has been promoted as a solution to avoid infection and even facilities were provided, in Madrid many got into trouble for this activity.

<img class="s t u gx ai" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3814/1\*y43TsHVBlmB6MoKszD3oXA.jpeg" width="1907" height="2076" srcSet="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1\*y43TsHVBlmB6MoKszD3oXA.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\*y43TsHVBlmB6MoKszD3oXA.jpeg 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"/>

RED ARCE general map proposed in Madrid to connect natural capital and consolidate urban green infrastructure.

In parallel, two years ago a [Master Plan](http://www.redbiodiversidad.es/sites/default/files/Resumen-ejecutivo.-Infraestructura-verde%20Ayto.%20Madrid.pdf) was proposed to update the General Urban Development Plan by incorporating a network of pedestrian routes and promoting the city’s green areas, trees and biodiversity.

However, the reality is diverging from prioritizing cycling and pedestrian mobility. Today, May 7th, Madrid continues to hinder sustainable mobility and keeps the parks closed to avoid crowding conditions. One would therefore ask where are people expected to flow during this initial phase?

It has to be stressed that the interpersonal distance of two meters required by the Government does not take into account that 65% of the streets in Madrid are less than 3.5 meters wide. If we consider that a single person without bags occupies approximately half a meter, walking the streets safely appears hardly feasible. Additionally, 9.8% of the streets are not even accessible to a wheelchair, being less than 1.2 meters wide.

Curiously, the narrowness of the sidewalks and their quality are reduced as the citizens’ income decrease. This is partly due to the fact that the majority of these neighbourhoods developed in the 90s, the so-called “[prodigious decade](https://www.ecestaticos.com/file/e1b7d1cf9492aa9f0f73063d3b243b07/1574444937-madrid.gif)” for Spanish urban planning that lasted until the 2007 crisis. In this, very favourable economic conditions and social context obtained, through changes in regulations, an exaggerated and disorganized urban growth resulting in a progressive discredit of public planning. Consequently, to fix this condition, the implementation of a new sustainable urban model should start with the most vulnerable areas of the city and then spreading. In line with the proclamation of “leaving no one behind” that our country’s leaders constantly acclaim.

Meanwhile, some temporary solutions to cope with the overall circulation problems have emerged. For instance, [Inspide](http://www.inspide.com/), a geospatial analytics company, has created a [free consultation tool](https://distanciamiento.inspide.com/) based on data from the Madrid City Council to facilitate pedestrians in finding out the roads width and thus ensuring a safe and pleasant itinerary while they wait for the parks to open again.

As we have seen, the crisis has highlighted the lack of available space for citizen mobility and is not due to the lack of solutions, but to the insufficiency of many areas of the capital with respect to light mobility and the general hegemony of the vehicle.

Madrid has become a city in which you can go everywhere by car or using public transports, but when the latter suffers structural problems in its performance, the inadequacy of light mobility infrastructure and the lack of open space for leisure is clearly manifested. The streets of Madrid are not prepared to perform the role of stage to play sports or nonstop walks. Now that the long-awaited walks and outdoor sports are possible, it is necessary to reclaim the green spaces of the city, as there is no need to mention the benefits generated by them for mental health. It is especially in these moments of recovery that open green areas should in fact be open, taking as a model what is done in other Spanish cities such as Valencia, Zaragoza or Barcelona where open spaces such as beaches and parks are welcoming their inhabitants.

If our goal is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, post-quarantine urban planning should learn from this virus the value of the positive insights emerged as a consequence: an encouragement in walking the streets, the need to build places where resting without environmental noise is possible and a commitment to prioritize the reproductive over the productive.

If, as in my opinion, each crisis implies a period of decision, it is time to judge and evaluate the course of our future. Now that everything has stopped, we can imagine a new city model where it is possible to put life at the centre. The post-quarantine city should incentivize sustainable mobility as a firm and global commitment. Manifests such as Massimo Paolini’s one presented in [Barcelona](https://manifiesto.perspectivasanomalas.org/en/manifiesto-2/) have already appeared, claiming the urgency of change as “_an opportunity to promote permanent measures to return the city to people, reorganize mobility, (re)naturalize the city, decommodification of housing and promote urban degrowth_”. We are in time to demand the recovery of green spaces and reclaim the public space that the car has invaded, monopolizing more than 80% of the public space surface, in favour of pedestrian paths, bicycle lanes and public transport.
