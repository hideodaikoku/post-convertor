_Situation in South Africa_

South Africa entered its 35-day lockdown on the 27th of March 2020. The government has shown remarkable leadership acting quickly to limit travel, close ports of entry, provide educative resources, and to track and trace infected people. Although lockdown confined everyone to their homes. What does this mean in a country riven with inequalities? COVID-19 flourishes on the underlying conditions that we created, especially the impossibility of affording a dignified life particularly for people bracketed in certain socio-political and economic contexts. What will accentuate inequalities are pre-existing practices of social abandonment such as austerity, sanctions, chauvinism, racism, colonialism, epistemic violence, devaluing peripherical knowledge circuits; and neoliberal corporatization amongst others that neglect and allows people to die.

COVID-19 exacerbates existing inequalities between the haves and the have nots. For the rich, this pandemic may mean an increase in savings. However, for the poor, it means financial ruin. For those living in freestanding properties in the suburbs, enjoying an uninterrupted salary, lockdown is like a spiritual retreat. However, most South Africans do not live like this. Many people live in dense neighborhoods such as a small shack with 10 other people, where only 46.3% of households have access to piped water in their dwellings.

The powerful words of a young woman who works as a preschool teacher in a fabricated creche provide an understanding of how social life in South Africa is determined by class:

_“This coronavirus scares me a lot and we have nothing to protect us from it only water and soap and that we don’t even have I mean soap_”

Additionally, domestic violence, rape, and child abuse are serious problems in South Africa. Most crimes are committed by people close to the victim. The lockdown measures impose stress on abusers, making it more difficult for the abused to escape.

We could argue that even though the virus can be destructive, it is how we organize our lives that give it the scope to cause destruction and inflict pain and sorrow. The race to return to “normal” and desire to each go back to business-as-usual in a context where others are still struggling or just starting to confront this global menace maintains our pre-existing condition — INEQUALITY.

_Measures to address COVID-19_

There is a tendency to treat Africans as naturally irrational, a place of gross incompetence, buffoonery, and the unimaginable or laughable. You can see this amplified during this pandemic. The other day President Cyril Ramaphosa during his address to the nation struggled to put on his face mask. This was shared across social media with accompanying laughing out loud emojis. So why do we laugh? This mishap is paraded as a symbol of stupidity and buffoonery that is continuously projected to the continent.

South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa’s face mask triggers hilarious meme fest (Source: [https://www.republicworld.com/entertainment-news/whats-viral/south-africa-president-cyril-ramaphosa-face-mask-gaffe-triggers-memes.html](https://www.republicworld.com/entertainment-news/whats-viral/south-africa-president-cyril-ramaphosa-face-mask-gaffe-triggers-memes.html)).

The African continent has long experience with pandemics, epidemics and disasters, such as Ebola, malaria, HIV/AIDS, cholera and malnutrition, just to name a few. For many years people have developed strategies to deal with extended disruptions to the ‘normalcy’ of life. In South Africa, we have more GeneXpert machines than any other country in the world. Designed for rapid Tuberculosis (TB) testing, they will be repurposed to assist in extensive COVID-19 testing. Health workers will be working across the country, doing door to door and mobile testing. Scientists and other experts in HIV and TB are already collaborating in vaccine-testing. We have access to good quality information, and we are producing knowledge too.

The South African government has proposed a stimulus package of US$166 Million, a COVID-19 Solidarity Fund, a temporary employment scheme, stepped up access to the Unemployment Insurance Fund for employees who have lost their jobs, and a tax subsidy of up to US$26.90 per month for each employee earning below US$349.50 per month. Badly affected businesses are permitted to delay 20% of the payment for employers’ tax liabilities, and small businesses have been given debt relief. Additional measures were announced by the President on 21 April, which included a US$26.9 billion. From this amount, US$2.2billion is specifically dedicated to increase social grant payouts between May and October and to cover the COVID-19 grant for the unemployed who are not currently receiving social grants. But the bulk of the stimulus package (US$10.6 billion) is earmarked to provide loan guarantees to big businesses with an annual turnover of between US$5.4 million and US$16.2 million. Additionally, the state has also established programs to distribute food parcels and hygiene products to vulnerable households.

_Change in urban lifestyle after COVID-19_

Our ethics of care requires radical change, and this cannot happen if our response to pandemics is centered on protecting the rational self. Care and consciousness of this interdependency need to form the moral fabric of any equitable response which privileges the protection and survival of humans and the planet rather than the abstract of this modern political and economic system. The ‘rational individual’ cannot be trusted to wash their hands, social distance, and care for others. The reason why we resort to the drastic measure of locking down to save others enforces false empathy and solidarity. But this requires a fundamental re-imagining of the state and its purpose, which focuses on a new political community and democratic dispensation founded essentially on care.

In Africa, the tightly woven umbilical cord between certain countries and the brutally oppressed societies and systems that criminally colonized us for decades instituted the accepted practice of externalizing expertise, especially in the health sector. What dignity does any person have left when the most basic and existential services such as health are deeply entrusted in the hands of people thousands of kilometers away? The irony is that we are reproducing the same cycle of colonial dependency. Thus, we need to build strong institutions on the African continent and delink from this brutal necropolitical ecosystem. Else, our responses to this pandemic will be limited by these colonial and postcolonial networks of subjugation and mimicry.

While it is important to treat and develop vaccines against this virus, we need more than ever to treat and develop vaccines against the drivers of inequality. Africa’s experience continues to emphasize that diseases are products of social relations, and therefore require interventions that transcend the biomedical. Hence, we need to use this rich experience to develop and deploy equitable and context-specific responses to outbreaks. What the world seems to have forgotten is that no one is safe, until everyone is safe.
