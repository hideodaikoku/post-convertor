Dubai: An Urban Spectacle fallen lackluster… for now

Dubai is one of the seven emirates in the United Arab Emirates and is the largest cosmopolitan in the country. Its transition from a mere desert to an illustrious metropolis is laudable. The city flourished since the discovery of pearls and trading oil with its neighbors among other activities that drove it to be one of the richest cities in the world. Dubai has ever since thrived primarily on tourism and other sectors like construction and real estate as the population grew. However, since mid-March, these sectors and many other businesses were impacted on a prolific scale, forcing them to shut down and some had to let go of staff. Just like many other countries globally, many businesses had to adapt to the ‘work from home’ routine. For the first time, Dubai was due to host the World Expo 2020 on the 20th of October but is now delayed until next year due to the ongoing pandemic.

What is unfortunate, just as in the rest of the world, is that there is a steady rise in the number of cases each day. On the bright side, Dubai has a much lower mortality rate with more recoveries each day as compared to the rest of the world. Dubai has always been stringent in terms of following the rules as imposed by the government as there are hefty fines/penalties if not adhered to and in some extreme cases, even deportation. With the current situation not being any different in that sense, there are strict protocols imposed by the government such as restrictions when stepping outside and following guidelines as mentioned by WHO like wearing masks and gloves, maintaining social distance, wash/sanitize our hands and groceries after shopping, etc.

Since March, as the severity of the effects of COVID-19 began to grow, Dubai Police announced to the public that they need to register for permits when heading outside and if you go outside other than the reasons claimed in the permit, the police will know. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, Dubai Police could decide whether or not to issue fines to people for moving about during the 24-hour coronavirus sterilisation programme. AI is being used along with speed radars to identify which vehicles have movement permits or belong to people working within vital sectors. This practice was undertaken by the government so that people avoid gathering in large groups or similar instances and just step out to get necessary essentials from the market/grocery store. The “movement restrictions weren’t to stop people’s lives but to reduce the physical contact between people and support the sterilisation programme, which aims to prevent the spread of coronavirus to keep the public safe.” — Brigadier Saif Muhair Al Mazroui, Director of the Traffic Department at Dubai Police _(Source: Gulf News)_

After noticing a pattern of steady recoveries and undertaking steps to slowly recuperate the city’s economy, the government took a calculated risk to change the curfew timings from 24 hours to 11 PM — 6 AM, over time. Businesses and malls steadily moved to 50% capacity in May from 30% in April. As per recent reports, under the directives from the government, shopping malls and the private sector can operate at 100 percent capacity starting Wednesday, 3 June 2020.’ _(Staff Report, Gulf News)_

As I am sure, the necessity to reopen businesses to full capacity was of utmost concern for the authorities to improve the economic conditions and bring financial stability, I do feel that there is a high degree of risk involved as now there are more folks heading outside and this is precisely the settings in which the virus thrives in as weather change does not seem to have a significant impact. Personally, as much as I venerate the government’s efforts in curbing the effects of this pandemic, something as treasured as life should and can never be compensated with anything else no matter how grave the circumstances. However, the paradox here is that I understand how a sustainable economy is essential for basic living without which an individual can fall into hopelessness leading to depression, anxiety, or subsequently even loss of life. Cases like these are noticed in such challenging and unprecedented times as many are losing their jobs all around the world including here in an ostentatious city like Dubai.

There are mixed feelings among people as life gets back to ‘normal’. As the pandemic cases are on the rise each day, there is fear that one may contract the virus on the way to work or vice-versa via transportation services like the metro or public buses which many rely on and are generally crowded. Simultaneously, there are those who are very eager to get back to their offices and meet their co-workers. ‘While many said the recent restrictions were “more or less manageable”, they expressed delight at being able to resume ‘normal’ routines again.’ _(Source: Khaleej Times)_

In spite of the challenges that the majority of the population had to undergo, the pandemic acted as a boon for the environment and flora-fauna to a great extent. Gazelles and peacocks were spotted roaming the streets of Dubai as people were locked indoors. _(Source: Gulf News)_

Another major upside of the lockdown is the substantial drop in the pollution levels globally, especially in the UAE. While places like Europe and China had a record drop in the pollution levels, a substantial reduction in the pollution levels is recorded in the UAE because of the stay at home measures implemented across the country.

Why UAE’s urban resilience matter?
==================================

Now that people have started to emerge from homes and economy running again, UAE’s Urban resilience, (the ability of a city to maintain continuity during a crisis and to adapt to the future) will be the key indicator. Those cities that have invested in smart infrastructure already have a leg up. The greater number of vital functions that have been moved online, the easier these services are to administer during and after the crisis. The keys to urban resilience in times of crisis are great infrastructure, cohesive communities, and good governance. When these factors link together, cities are able to rise to just about any challenge.

Through its early embrace of smart city development, both Abu Dhabi and Dubai have been infusing the urban environment with services and resources for continuity. That is why our physical environment can stand up to the harsh weather of the Arabian Gulf and this crisis. As home to more than 200 nationalities, the UAE has cohesive communities built into the fabric of society.

The DubaiNow app by Smart Dubai makes more than 85 government services available with a tap of a button. The Dubai Health Authority has even created a telemedicine application that enables citizens to speak with medical professionals without even leaving their homes. Being able to receive care through digital services is key to the country’s containment strategy. In Abu Dhabi, the Tamm initiative is moving government services online with the goal of reducing in-person visits by consolidating service transactions into a single touchpoint. These services were designed to save residents time, but they have proven a boon during social distancing. Instead of having to go across town for a doctor’s appointment or to pay an electricity bill, residents can interact through their smartphones. The idea has worked well in other parts of the world.

<img class="s t u hm ai" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*f8RvAYsYQnPmQICvwreK-w.jpeg" width="700" height="440" srcSet="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1\*f8RvAYsYQnPmQICvwreK-w.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1\*f8RvAYsYQnPmQICvwreK-w.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1\*f8RvAYsYQnPmQICvwreK-w.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*f8RvAYsYQnPmQICvwreK-w.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"/>

As global supply chains are strained under the weight of the current crisis, the ability of the UAE to protect its local food and water sources is critical. Furthermore, global supply chains will not simply bounce back when the spread of the virus is halted, which means the UAE’s sustainability initiatives will be all the more crucial. With the benefit of hindsight, the UAE has been preparing for this crisis for years when it comes to smart city and resilience measures. This is partially due to the rapid rise of the local technology ecosystem and the environmental challenges the country has always faced. The UAE has also reached out to partners across the emerging world to find solutions to these challenges.

Sustainability through technological innovation and infrastructure was a major topic of discussion during the tenth session of the United Nations World Urban Forum that was held in Abu Dhabi. Delegates from cities around the world crafted new approaches to resilience in light of climate change. Now those ideas are being applied to the coronavirus pandemic.

In conclusion, these are trying times. This period is a test for the global economy and virtually every country in the world. By luck and circumstance, the UAE has invested in the infrastructure that will help the country quickly recover. This is the nature of resilience and one reason we can look with confidence to the brave new world that emerges when this virus is under control.
